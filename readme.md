# Simple Web Application with Routing

This project is a simple web application with routing for two HTML pages: `index.html` and `message.html`. The web application also handles static resources such as `style.css` and `logo.png`, and supports form handling on the `message.html` page.

## Technologies

- Python for running HTTP and Socket servers
- MongoDB for storing data received from the form
- Docker and Docker Compose for containerization of the application and database
